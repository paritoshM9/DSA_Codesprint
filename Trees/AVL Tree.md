**In HB(k), if k = 1 (if balance factor is one), such a binary search tree is called an AVL tree. That
means an AVL tree is a binary search tree with a balance condition: the difference between left
subtree height and right subtree height is at most 1.**

### Properties of AVL Trees:

**A binary tree is said to be an AVLtree, if:**

• It is a binary search tree, and

• For any node X, the height of left subtree of X and height of right subtree of X differ by atmost 1.
